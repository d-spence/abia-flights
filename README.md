# Austin-Bergstrom International Airport Flights

This is an unofficial flight status monitoring app based on the official Austin airport flight tracker. It displays the current arrival and departure status of flights and allows simple searching by airline, flight number and city. Flights can be sorted by various categories as well.

The frontend was created using React and Tailwind css with a few other utility packages. On the backend I built a simple express API server to manage the requests to the abia data server and convert the xml data to json format (using xml2js).

This project is in no way affiliated or sponsored by the Austin-Bergstrom airport. It is not commercial in nature nor do I intend it to be. I make no claims or guarantees to the accuracy of the data presented on the app.
